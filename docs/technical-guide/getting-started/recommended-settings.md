To self-host Penpot, youâ€™ll need a server with the following specifications:

* **CPU:** 1-2 CPUs
* **RAM:** 4 GiB of RAM
* **Disk Space:** Disk requirements depend on your usage. Disk usage primarily involves the database and any files uploaded by users.

This setup should be sufficient for a smooth experience with typical usage (your mileage may vary).
